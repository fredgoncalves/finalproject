# finalproject

For my final project I made a set of pannels that rotate to ccreate bigger os smaller apertures, as a mock up of a shading controlled facade. The most challenging part was to figure out and make the structure that connect the plywood pannels to the servo motors and the servos to the frame. The code is pretty straight forward, taking as an input the value of light from a LDR and using it to drive the amount of openness of the composition. Due to lack of longer jump wires, the final set is demonstrating only the opening and closing actions, not connected to the amount of light.
